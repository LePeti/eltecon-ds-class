Context
Movies data are available on IMDb and many other websites with average votes, vote numbers, reviews and descriptions. 
While IMDb is the most trustworthy source for data, other websites as FilmTV.it can provide the information on how users 
from different countries rate the movies compared to each other.

Content
Each row represents a movie available on FilmTV.it, with the original title, year, genre, duration, country, director, actors, average vote and votes. 
The fie in the English version contains 52,536 movies and 12 attributes, 
while the Italian version contains one extra-attribute for the local title used when the movie was published in Italy.

Acknowledgements
Data has been scraped from the publicly available website https://www.filmtv.it.

Inspiration
The purpose of this dataset is to provide data regarding the rates and the number of votes assigned to each film by Italian users, 
which can be compared with data available on other movie-related websites.
